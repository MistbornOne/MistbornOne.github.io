### How do you react when difficult circumstances arise?

Life isn't always fair. It's not easy. Difficult circumstances will arise for all of us from time to time. The question is how will you choose to respond during tough times?

It is tempting to give into our emotional response and allow that to dictate how we react. This, however, is not good. Emotions are fleeting and driven by hormones flooding your body. They are indifferent to reality outside your current circumstance. They have no perspective.

The better way to process difficult circumstances is to realize that no matter how bad it gets, nothing has the power to take away your ability to _choose_ how you will respond.

When you come to realize this, it's a superpower.

But, like many lessons in life, we have to learn this one over and over again. At least, I do. I have a tendency to grasp this for a while, then when life gets easier, I forget. The next difficult season arises and I have to relearn all over again.

I'm in one right now, actually. But, God is good and I am reminded today that _I get to choose how I respond_ to my circumstances.

Read Psalm 23. It's a beautiful picture of the fact that God is sovereign and cares for our needs. He leads us to safety, even in the midst of the most dangerous or perilous circumstances. He _never_ leaves our side.

If this is true, and I believe it is, then we have nothing to worry about when life gets tough. Thus, the proper response is one that is rooted in our belief system and our ability to choose.

Now, even if you aren't a Christian, you can still glean insight from this. Stoic philosophers taught the same principle and Ryan Holiday has done a great job outlining it thoroughly in his book [The Obstacle is the Way](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Expanded-10th-Anniversary/dp/0593719913/ref=asc_df_0593719913?mcid=6d5867e0762a32c7983afd7f150d7f6c&hvocijid=9606282633321745275-0593719913-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9606282633321745275&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9013457&hvtargid=pla-2281435180218&psc=1).

No matter what your worldview is, you have the ability to choose how you respond. Never let anyone take that away from you.

Like anything, all it takes is putting one foot in front of the other. Eventually, you'll make it through to the other side. Greener pastures will come again. Let that carry you through the dark valley.
