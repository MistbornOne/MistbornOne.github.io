## Welcome To My Blog And Porfolio!

##### My personal journey to becoming a developer from ground zero.

**A Little History**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had a love for learning languages for as long as I can remember. I lived in Okinawa, Japan for the first five years of my life. Being exposed to multiple languages while I was acquiring my ability to communicate verbally seems to have unlocked a lifelong fascination with becoming a polyglot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first attempt at learning to code was ten years ago. I wanted to learn to be a front end developer and took several Udemy courses on Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoyed the process, but I was quite discouraged by how difficult it was to break into the industry as a developer, so I gave up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade I've spent a lot of time learning about workflow automation and have built some fun scripts using AI. The itch to learn to code has come in waves during that time, but I've just ignored it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I've been using LLM's for personal and work research quite a bit. As I was using these tools to "vibe code" (though I didn't know what that meant at the time) I decided it would be best to learn the basics of Python, so I could debug as needed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I started learning Python, I felt the all familiar rush of excitement that comes with learning a new language and knew it was time to truly give it a go. After a few weeks of messing around with different free resources, I came across boot.dev and dove into the backend dev program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site will be my notebook to catalog my personal progress in becoming a developer. I haven't decided if I want to stay with backend development only or study full stack development, but that's a future me problem üòÅ.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow along as I share my learnings and provide a resource for others who are just starting out. Ideally, I want to create a site that will help others who are starting from ground zero become proficient enough to fulfill their coding dreams.

Since this is the first post, it feels fitting to say:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
