### Mindset is _everything_.

Sales is arguably a mindset game and **most** salespeople get it wrong.

Let me tell you why...

Most sales reps I have spoken to over the last decade have told me that the reason they went into sales to begin with is to **_make more money_**. There's no doubt that making commission is a massive upside to working in sales - but the issue arises when the initial motivation becomes the focus of your daily mindset.

When I was a young sales rep, I would often start my day, week, and especially month focused on how much commission I had made the prior month and how much I _wanted_ to make in the current month. I was so caught up in this that every lost deal would put me in a bad mood. I would get frustrated at the opportunity cost of losing another dael and think:

_I just lost $$$ in commission_.

Now, don't hear me wrong, I was still wildly successful for someone who had just started a sales career after transitioning from working as a chef (and making next to nothing), but my mindset was wrong.

### Enter the mentor...

One day a mentor told me that I should approach every day with a **winner's** **mindset**.

His exact advice was as follows:

> **"Wake up and tell yourself _today I'm going to win 10 deals_.**
>
> **Don't just say it.**
>
> **Believe it.**
>
> **Then go to the office and every time your phone rings think _I'm going to win this one_."**

Now, that may sound silly, but I decided to try it. I **stopped** worrying about my commission and started approaching every call with a positive attitude. When I lost a deal, I shrugged it off and went to the next one with the winner's mentality.

Soon enough this evolved into a mindset where I truly wanted to _help_ my customers and so I would go into everyday telling myself I was going to win by helping my customers win.

### Can you guess what happened?

My commissions doubled the first month. I couldn't believe it, but I decided I'd keep going to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Then the second month my commissions were higher than the first... and the same with the third month.

By the end of that year I was making six-figures for the first time in my life.

By shifting my mindset to be focused on helping the customer and going into every call as if it was already won, _my financial situation drastically changed_.

### Challenge

The challenge is simple - think about how you approach each day and consider whether you have the right mindset or not.

I am not claiming that you will get rich simply by adopting the mindset described above. I _wish_ it was that easy, but it's not. You will still have to work harder than everyone else, every single day. You'll still have to deal with the 80/20 rule of deals lost/won. You'll still get hung up on, yelled at, called names, ignored, and pestered by your sales manager.

I am not even suggesting that my mindset is _the_ one for every salesperson.

All I'm trying to say is the way you **think** about things matters and adopting a new mindset can change your life for the better. I sure am glad I gave it a try all those years ago.

If you're interested in more resources on mindset, I'd highly recommend a few books that changed my perspective even further and one I've read at least once a year for the last six years.
