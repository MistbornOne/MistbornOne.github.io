**Those who code spend a _lot_ of time in the terminal.** I actually take my daily notes for work and life in the terminal in addition to any coding projects I work on in my spare time.

When you become comfortable using it, the terminal becomes a magical place, where you can fly around like a wizard performing all sorts of tasks without ever needing to lift your fingers off the keyboard. Seriously... who uses a mouse these days ðŸ˜œ.

I had some spare time while on PTO recently and decided it would be a fun project to build a website based on the terminal. It is purposefully _not mobile friendly_, because we don't use the terminal on our phones, but rather on our computers.

Below is a little preview of the interactivity:

Fun, right? There are a few little easter eggs hidden around as well.

You can play around in the project yourself (on your computer) by going to [Ian's Terminal](https://ianwatkins.netlify.app)

Let me know what you think. Shoot me an [email](mailto:info@ianwatkins.dev)!
