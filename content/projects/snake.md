## The Snake Game

A classic game from the early days of desktop computing, the snake game is a lot of nostalgia packed into a small screen.  I completed the asteroids game for Boot.dev and wanted to take on my first decent sized project all on my own, so I dove right in.

This took me about 3 hours or so of solid coding split between two evenings, but with some clever Googling and GPT prompts, I was able to figure out anything that I didn't understand on my own.

I decided to do the code as one file rather than multiple, since it's fairly straightforward at the end of the day.  I also really wanted to practice OOP and clean code with this one.

You can find the code in my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MistbornOne/games/tree/main).

**Below is a demo of the game in action:**
