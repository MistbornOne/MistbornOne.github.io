## Inkdrop Habit Tracker

As a long time user of Notion, I fell in love with the idea of using my notes app to also keep track of my tasks and daily habits. After making the switch to [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app) for my main notetaking application, I wanted to have the same capability - so I made this plugin!

I hope this is useful to the community and it's my great pleasure to continue learning through contributing to an amazing tool.

See my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MistbornOne/inkdrop-habit-tracker) for more information.  If you're an Inkdrop user, please download and let me know if you have any feedback!

## What Does The Plugin Do?

Track your daily habits right inside Inkdrop - without it being distracting or in your face.

Check off habits, view current and longest streaks, and see your progress over time.

## 📍 Roadmap

One planned future enhancement will be to add a graphical stats view that allows you to see your stats over time on a chart view.
