## Bookbot Project

The first real CLI project that I built was a tool which receives a .txt file as input and prints out some data. While this isn't the most impressive program ever built, it means a lot to me, because it was the project that proved to me _I can do this_.

Below is an example, using Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_:

```bash

============ BOOKBOT ============

I may come back to this later and add some other features. I've considered adding additional file types to be analyzed and building in more data types to be returned.
