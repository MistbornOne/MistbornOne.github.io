<p>Ask any top sales performer the secret to their success, and chances are, you won‚Äôt get a flashy answer. You won‚Äôt hear about a secret script or a viral campaign or some once-in-a-lifetime pitch that changed everything. What you‚Äôll hear ‚Äî if they‚Äôre being honest ‚Äî is something <em>much simpler</em>, and far less exciting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>üí°<strong>Sales Success Comes Down To Consistency, Discipline, And A Commitment To The Basics.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, success in sales comes down to doing the boring work. Every day, for long periods of time.</p>
<p>This is why I love the tweet by Shane Parrish from July 2023. It articulated so well what I&rsquo;ve long wrestled with internally.</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúSuccess comes down to doing the obvious thing for an extraordinary period of time, without convincing yourself that you‚Äôre smarter than you think you are.‚Äù</em><br>
‚Äî Shane Parrish, July 30, 2023</p></blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs deceptively simple advice. And yet, it‚Äôs exactly the kind of wisdom that separates a flash-in-the-pan rep from a perennial top performer.</p>
<h2 id="the-myth-of-overnight-success">The Myth of Overnight Success</h2>
<p>In sales, it‚Äôs easy to get distracted by the myth of overnight success. Social media feeds are full of people hitting President‚Äôs Club in their first year, signing seven-figure deals, or launching side hustles that ‚Äúblew up.‚Äù But what rarely makes the highlight reel is the daily grind behind those wins: the hundreds of cold calls, the follow-up emails that went unanswered, the pipeline reviews, the rejections, the learning curves, the deals that fell through.</p>
<p><em>Most of the time</em>, success is not glamorous ‚Äî it‚Äôs repetitive.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs about showing up every day and doing the foundational work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researching accounts before your outreach</li>
<li>Following up - sometimes 12+ times - until you get a response</li>
<li>Logging activity and keeping your CRM clean</li>
<li>Practicing critical listening to identify real pain-points and tailoring your pitch to highlight how your value prop solves their <em>real problem</em></li>
<li>Building and maintaining relationships that may not pay off for months to years</li>
<li>And perhaps most important of all: Being available when your prospect needs you</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these things are ‚Äúsexy.‚Äù But they are what drive results over time.</p>
<h2 id="the-obvious-work-most-people-avoid">The Obvious Work Most People Avoid</h2>
<p>Sales isn‚Äôt a mystery. We all know what leads to pipeline and closed revenue. We all know the quips like &ldquo;people buy from people.&rdquo; The challenge isn‚Äôt the knowing ‚Äî it‚Äôs the doing.</p>
<p>Parrish calls this ‚Äúdoing the obvious thing.‚Äù</p>
<p>In sales, doing the obvious thing equals showing up every day and making touches - calls, texts, emails, in-person visits, etc and doing it in a way that allows you to stand out from the crowd. There&rsquo;s no shortage of AI driven or copy &amp; paste outreach today. I get a dozen emails a day that I can immediately tell were drafted this way.</p>
<p><strong>Strip away all the noise and be authentic.</strong> If you take nothing else away from this article, let it be this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t treat your prospects like they are a number, <em>treat them like a person</em>. Try to have real conversations. If you can, create unique experiences for them to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>For instance, there were several accounts early on in my career that I won by sending them a handwritten card with a personalized note and a gift card to Starbucks to &ldquo;cover the coffee I was going to buy you if you hadn&rsquo;t ghosted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time, I was just trying to get a call back - and you know what? It worked. Not every time, but enough of the time to make a difference.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a 100% success guaranteed/microwave result process either. This type of personalized touch only worked if I had done my homework (aka the obvious thing) for several weeks. Typically I would try conventional methods for at least a month or two before I went down this route. Many times, I never even had to do this, because said conventional methods led to a real conversation.</p>
<p>The point is, don&rsquo;t chase hacks or quick fixes. Pick up the phone and make calls. Focus on having real conversations. Listen more than you speak. Qualify (or disqualify) your leads and don&rsquo;t just shove a solution that has no value for them. Answer the phone when they call. Create experiences that make you stick out in their mind.</p>
<p>Do this every day for long enough and you will succeed. Where most reps go wrong is giving up on individual prospects too soon - or - on the process altogether because they don&rsquo;t get results as fast as they&rsquo;d like.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show up daily. Do the work. Trust the process.</p></blockquote>
